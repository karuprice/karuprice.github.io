The plan is to keep this blog as a record of study and search for my first job in web/software development.
 I'll make a n note of topics studied and my recent thoughts.  I've never kept a blog before, nor considered myself a writer,
if nothing else this blog will provide practice as a wordsmith.  Is blogging like listening to your own recorded voice, nobody likes to 
hear their own voice, right?  Or read their own writing?  I'll soon find out.
