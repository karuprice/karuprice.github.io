flexboxfroggy.com is a fun website that helps to teach how to use the flexbox CSS layout mode by guiding frogs to their lilly pads.

Time Taken

1 hour

Take away points

1/ Designate the element as flex or inline-flex, with out doing this your element won't be a flex container or children flex items.
2/ Flex-direction sets the axis to be either rows or columns. Justify-content sets where content is set on the axis set by flex-direction.
3/ Great resource- css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
